## About this Project

The idea of the Plugin is:

_“Increase productivity and decrease time spent with front-end code”._

## Why?

This project was designed to accelerate my company's software development and to help everyone waste time with simple and repetitive Widget creation processes.\
I will be happy if you can help me with as many PR's as you like so that we can perfect the plugin more and more
